# Distinguishing COVID-19 From Other Forms of Viral Pneumonia Using Lung CT Scans

Previous COVID-19 research has observed lung lesions of COVID-19 are generally peripherally distributed and bilateral, but other viral pneumonia lesions are not subject to those standards. Since these factors distinguishing the pneumonias are location based, we propose a novel method of COVID-19 classification by using segmented overlays as part of the classification process. 

The performance of our proposed method on Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital dataset is showin the following table:

|Model|Train|Val|Test|Avg Precision|Avg Recall|Subject-wise Accuracy
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ResNet152|99%|0.6888|0.8420|0.8473|0.8444|0.880
